TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

#dictionary
my_dict = {"key":"value}

#returns the value associated with the key
my_dict["key"]

my_dict["key"] = {"something":"else" , "wow":0}
my_dict["key"]["wow"]
#returns the value of "wow"

#json file

#Alternative file handling
with open(newfile, 'w') as history_book: #Advantage is that you can write to many files
    history_book.write(name + " is not cool")

#Reading Files

readlines() - reads whole file but in array of lines

#New Line
