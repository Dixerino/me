TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
TAXI Activity:
    Could have improved the code from ifs/elifs statements
    First checks if hand or shoulder is found 
    Then notes down the co ordinate if one is found
    Step repeated and refreshes constantly so while it doesn't find both at the same time it should refresh quick enough so the coordinate doesn't change
