TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
DATA PROJECT (UPDATE)
Found another data set to compare with; the demographic and household projections of LGAs and Regional Areas

PLAN
is to compare the proportion of modes of transport with the household demographic and draw trends between them
from this, also project a forecast of this trend through expanding the graph
